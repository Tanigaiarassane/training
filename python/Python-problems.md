We have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling. We are in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling. Return True if we are in trouble.

monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
monkey_trouble(True, False) → False

Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.

front3('Java') → 'JavJavJav'
front3('Chocolate') → 'ChoChoCho'
front3('abc') → 'abcabcabc'

----
Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum.

sum_double(1, 2) → 3
sum_double(3, 2) → 5
sum_double(2, 2) → 8
