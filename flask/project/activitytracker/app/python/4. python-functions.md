##Functions


Functions in python are a block of organzied code that perform specific action
It provides modularity and leads to re-usable code.


###Defining a function:

	def <function name>(<argument list>):
	
		return
		
- Functions start with the keyword **def** followed by **name** and **(<argument list>):** at the end

- We can pass paramenters to the function inside ()

- It optinally returns a value or expression. If no value is returned, it is considered as none.
- The first line of the function can be a document string.

-----

###Calling a function:
 A function needs to be called with the arugment list defined in the function enclosed within ()
 		
 		printing (a,b,c)
 
The arguments passed in the function call can be of various types.

----
		
###Parameters of a function:

Aguments defined during the definition of a function is called the parameters of the function

- All parameters in python are passed by reference (if you chage what the parameter refers to inside the function, the change is reflected outside the function)

- A function can be called with a set of argument list. There are 4 types of arguments in python

	-  Required arguments
	-  Keyword arguments
	-  Default arguments
	-  Variable length arguments

	
####Required arguments:
 - Here the arguments are passed to the function in the correct positional order. The number of arguments and order while calling function should match the ones in the function definition

 def printing(str):
    print str   
Here the number of arguments in the function call should match the function definition else it gives syntax error (TypeError)

  
####Keyword argument:
This is in relation to the function call. Here the argument value is called with the parameter name. In this case, the arguments can be in passed in different order.
 
def printing (name, age):
    print "{} Name is of {} age".format(name,age)
     
printing (age = 25, name = "tani")
 
 Here the function is called with the same number of arguments, but the order is not maintained. Instead the keyword arguments is provided while calling the function.
 
####Default argument:
Here a default value is assumend when the value is not passed during the function call. The default value is provided during the function definition.

	def printing (name='tani', age=25):
    	print "{} Name is of {} age".format(name,age)
     
	>>> printing (age = 25, name = "Ruben")
	Ruben Name is of 25 age

	>>> printing (age= 35 )
	tani Name is of 35 age

Here the default value for name is assumed while the function is executed.
 
####Variable length argument

This is used in the function calling when you need to pass more arguments that it was defined in the function.

The definition starts with the formal arguments and then the variable lenght arguments

	def printing( name, age, *var_arg_tuple):
		print "{} Name is of {} age".format(name,age) 
		for var in var_arg_tuple:
			print var

	>>> printing("tan",25)
	tan Name is of 25 age
	>>> printing("tan",25,33,45)
	tan Name is of 25 age
	33
	45

 - A function can contain variable length argumetns alone also.

-------
###Scope of variables: Local Vs Global.

All  variables declared inside the function have function scope. Variables declared with global scope can be accessed and modified within a function body. All  variables declared inside the function have function scope. Variables declared with global scope can be accessed and modified within a function body.

###Accessing global variables:

In order to access a global variable inside the functio, use the global keyword and the variable name inside the function body. If the global variable is not mentioned, the variable defined inside the function will contain function scope.

	counter = 1 

	def doLotsOfStuff():
    
    	global counter

    	for i in (1, 2, 3): 
        	counter += 1

	doLotsOfStuff()

	print counter


###Anonymous functions:
Anonymous functions are functions without names and declared using lamba
 
 
lambda \<argument list\>:\<expression\>
 
 
	>>> sum = lambda a,b:a+b
	>>> sum(4,5)
	9

 
 - They have their own name space and uses the values passed by the parameters
 
- Lambda cannot use print - it requires an expression
 
-I They can take any number of arguments, but can return only one expression
 
### Functions inside a function:
Inner functions can use the enclosure scope

def test_1(name):
  
  def testi_2():
     print name
  test_2

	
---- 
 
Pythons functions are first class object. They are like any other objects like integer, strings.

They can be assigned to variable, passed to a function as parameter or returned from a function


1. Function inside a function - for encapsulation
you cannot access the inner function from the outside scope.

2. Keepinâ€™ it DRY
3. Closures and Factory Functions


----
>>> def fruitfunc():... print "I'm a fruit."
>>> def vegetablefunc():... print "I'm a vegetable.">>>>>> lookup = {'fruit': fruitfunc, 'vegetable': vegetablefunc}>>> lookup{'vegetable': <function vegetablefunc at 0x4028980c>,'fruit': <function fruitfunc at 0x4028e614>}>>> lookup['fruit']()I'm a fruit.>>> lookup['vegetable']()I'm a vegetable.
